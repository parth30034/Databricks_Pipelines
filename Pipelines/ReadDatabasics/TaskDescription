Task

Write a PySpark pipeline that:

Reads both datasets.

Filters orders from January & February 2024 only.

Calculates total spend per customer for these months.

Joins with returns to find % of orders returned per customer.

Sorts the result by highest return %.

Hints for Step-by-Step

Step 1: Read CSVs → spark.read.option("header", "true").csv(path)

Step 2: Convert order_date to date → to_date(col("order_date"))

Step 3: Filter months using month() & year()

Step 4: Aggregate using groupBy().agg(sum(), count())

Step 5: Left join with returns & calculate percentage
